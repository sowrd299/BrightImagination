    <b>Understanding the
    Ko, Chapter 2</b>

    One of the most striking things about the Ko is that they
    work always in pairs. The idea of being alone, or even of being in an odd-numbered
    group, is unthinkable in Ko society. Ko pairings tend to last a very long time,
    but are not romantic. It is not uncommon to see quartets form, where both members
    of a partnership becomes romantically involved with opposite members of another
    parntership. The Ko have cited the power of two minds over one as a leading factor
    in the success of their Ko-Opperations, but this has yet to be varrified.'
